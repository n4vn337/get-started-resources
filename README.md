### Programming
We will be using programming to automate our works. Also known as scripting.


### Linux
Linux is an extremely popular operating system for hackers. There are two main reasons behind this. First off, Linux's source code is freely available because it is an open source operating system. This means that Linux is very easy to modify or customize. And top of that if you install distro's like Kali or Parrot OS you get a bunch of security tools pre installed. A hacker kit right.

Studying the source code of such tools strongly benefits both attackers and defenders. A network hacker will certainly encounter the libnet library and its derivatives, which let programmers send custom Ethernet frames and IP packets.

### Web Application Penetration Testing
A penetration test, also known as a pen test, is a simulated cyber attack against your computer system to check for exploitable vulnerabilities. In the context of web application security, penetration testing is commonly used to augment a web application firewall (WAF).
